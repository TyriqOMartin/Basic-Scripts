###DESCRIPTION: This script will ask the user what their favorite food is, and print a message telling them what their favorite food is.
###DATE: 2/27/2023

###Below, line 14 is asking the user what their favorite food is. This is done by using the echo command

echo "What is your favorite food?"

###Below, line 20 is taking in the input from the user and storing it in a variable.
###This is done using the read command, which allows users to enter an input, and their input can be stored into a variable. 
###In this case the users input is being stored in the variable 'favFood'. 

read favFood

###Below, line 30 is printing a message including the value of the variable favFood that was
###taken from the input of the user.
###To include the variable, you have to use the dollar sign ($) right behind the variable, and the whole message has
###to be in double quotes (""), as you see below. If you put the message in single quotes (''), it won't use the value of the variable.
###So in this case, instead of it printing the value tooken from the user and stored in the variable, it will treat the variable
###like it is a normal piece of text, just printing the $ with the variable name, instead of the value entered by the user.
###Thats how it works when using the echo command.

echo "Your favorite food is $favFood."
